# imageEditor
Take one image and resize and add an unsharp mask.

The image will be resized to a 200x200, 120x120, and 85x85, and then the 200x200 image will have a canvas
size change to make it 300x200. The first three resized images will each be given an unsharp mask to increase
the quality of the photo.
